Given the list
    names = ['john', 'jacob', 'anabel', 'jonathan', 'jack', 'tabita', 'winifred', 'jalang']

- loop through the lists and return true for names that begin with the letter 'j' else return false
    hint: print('its {} that {} begins with a "j"'.format(True/False, name))

- loop through and return the name with the longest length

- sort through the names and print them individually with their index(position)

- find the length of all names in the list

- find the length of the list

- loop through the list and return the names whose length are even numbers

- loop through the list and return the names whose length are odd numbers


    use the print(''.format()) syntax for all your outputs
